# Overview

This tool acts as a simple wrapper for [etl2pcapng.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/etl2pcapng).

ETL files, generated by using commands such as "netsh trace start", are Windows in-box packet capture and event collection solution. Think of ETL/ETW logging as something similar to tcpdump plus strace plus dtrace Linux/Unix logging, but in a single tool. The ETL file format cannot be natively opened by any currently supported external tool, which posed a problem for people who want to use the in-box packet capture functionality.

etl2pcapng was built to extract packet in ETL and convert them to a Wireshark readable format, pcapng. This PowerShell wrapper extends the functionality and provided automated management and updates of etl2pcapng.

### Convert-Etl2Pcapng

Used to automate etl2pcapng conversion. Accepts a literal path to a location containing ETL files, or the literal path to a single ETL file. Paths from the pipeline are accepted.

The Recurse parameter will traverse child directories for ETL files. Only valid when the path is a directory.

The Out parameter can be used to store the results in a new location; otherwise, the same path as the ETL file is used.

### Register-Etl2Pcapng

__*Requires elevated rights (Run as administrator)*__

Registers a shell context menu item for Convert-Etl2Pcapng. Right-clicking on an ETL fill will show an option "Convert with etl2pcapng". This will execute Convert-Etl2Pcapng with default settings against the ETL file.

UseVerbose and UseDebug can be used to enable cli logging to troubleshoot issues with the menu option.

### Unregister-Etl2Pcapng

__*Requires elevated rights (Run as administrator)*__

Unregisters the shell context menu item for Convert-Etl2Pcapng. This will remove the option to right-click on an ETL file and select "Convert with etl2pcapng". 

### Update-Etl2Pcapng

Gets the newest version of etl2pcapng.exe from GitHub and returns the path to etl2pcapng.exe to the caller. This generally does not need to be run as Convert-Etl2Pcapng executes this cmdlet. 

GitHub is only queried every 7 days or when the Force parameter is used.

The module files, including etl2pcapng, are stored in %LocalAppData%\etl2pcapng so an elevated prompt is not needed to execute the commands.
